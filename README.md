# mal - Make a Lisp

Please see https://github.com/kanaka/mal for more information on what MAL is.

My implementation is in mygo/ since there is already an implementation in Go, that I wasn't looking at. This was just for the learning experience.

This implementation is fully capabable of self hosting and passes all tests, also when running the test suite when running the mal implementation of mal on this interpreter.
