# mal - Make a Lisp

my attempt at in implementation of MAL. Please see https://github.com/kanaka/mal for more information on what MAL is.

My implementation is in mygo/ since there is already an implementation in Go, that i'm not looking at. This is just for the learning experience.

This implementation is now fully capabable of self hosting and passes all (non-optional) tests when running the mal implementation of mal on this interpreter.
